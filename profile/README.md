# MCP Auth

*Plug-and-play auth for MCP servers*

No deep dives into specs. No boilerplate. Just auth that does its job.

**MCP Auth** gives you everything you need to add production-ready auth to your MCP server, without losing weeks to spec docs and edge cases.

Here's what you get:

1. An updated list of OAuth 2.1 and OpenID Connect providers that pass the MCP compliance check.
2. Provider-agnostic libraries and utilities to plug auth into your MCP server.
3. Practical tutorials and copy-pasteable examples to get you up and running fast.
